## Claude 3 Features and New Messages API

The text completions API for Claude is now in legacy mode and it is recommended to migrate to 
the new Messages API. The Messages API is backward compatible with current Claude Models on Bedrock and requires that a modified JSON body be passed to the invoke methods.

The multi-modal capability of Claude 3 allows for input of not only text but also an image that you can 
ask questions about.

This folder contains examples of the new Messages API and compares it with the legacy Text completions API. In addition, we provide an example of the new mulimodal capability of the Claude 3 model.
